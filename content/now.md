## now

Now is a concept I have seen on a couple of other blogs and is inspired on [now](https://nownownow.com/about).

### day job

I'm currently employed as a DevOps Engineer at Skyline Communications (more about this and previous professional experiences on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xdoubleu/)).

### spare time

In my spare time I'm quite a busy bee. I'll try to list most of my busy keeping here.

#### music

I love music, in so many ways. The social aspects, the artifacts produced by artists of almost every genre.
Besides listening to music, I'm trying to get into mixing music but will need a lot of practice.
Next to this, I'm also organizing some local music events in Roeselare.

#### workshops

I don't get to give a lot of workshops (typically around three a year), but I do really enjoy them and try to go the extra mile. Feel free to reach out if you find something interesting on my overview at [workshops](/workshops).

#### projects

Basically, if I have a problem which can only be solved by custom software I'll take care of it.
Currently my main focus is my [goal-tracker](https://github.com/xdoubleu/goal-tracker) which I use to aggregate data for reading & gaming goals.

#### reading & gaming

Like last year, I'm trying to read 24 books this year (you can track my progress on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114660594-xander-warszawski)).
I'm also trying to work through my gaming backlog a bit, aiming to reach 50% avg. completion rate on Steam (you can track my progress on [completionist.me](https://completionist.me/steam/profile/76561198127953838)).
