## now

### day job

I'm currently employed as a DevOps Engineer at Skyline Communications (more about this and previous professional experiences on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xdoubleu/)).

### spare time

In my spare time I'm quite a busy bee. I'll try to list most of my busy keeping here.

#### music

I love music, in so many ways. The social aspects, the artifacts produced by artists of almost every genre. You can have a peek at what I'm currently listening to on [volt.fm](https://volt.fm/xdoubleu).

Besides listening to music, I'm trying to get into mixing music but will need a lot of practice.

Next to this, I'm also organizing some local music events in Roeselare.

#### projects

Basically, if I have a problem which can only be solved by custom software I'll take care of it.
Currently my main focus is my [goal-tracker](https://github.com/xdoubleu/goal-tracker) which I use to aggregate data for reading & gaming goals.

#### reading & gaming

Like last year, I'm trying to read 24 books this year (you can track my progress on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114660594-xander-warszawski)).
I'm also trying to work through my gaming backlog a bit, aiming to reach 50% avg. completion rate on Steam (you can track my progress on [completionist.me](https://completionist.me/steam/profile/76561198127953838)).
